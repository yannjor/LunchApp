-	So far I have added classes MenuFinder, MenuFilter and LunchApp.
	Class MenuFinder includes methods getFazerMenus and getSodexoMenus which work quite well. 
	MenuFilter includes methods filterAllergens and filterFoodType which also work all right.
	LunchApp (the GUI) can display the menus and refresh them, but the rest of the functionality is still in progress.

-	MenuFinder has been tested and works okay. 

-	No major unsolved errors have occurred so far.

-	The workload so far is about 25h

-	I’m a bit ahead of my plan so far.

-	You can now filter menus with the GUI. You can also select a favorite restaurant,
 	which will save it to favRes.txt so that the next time you open the app, that restaurant will have a pink background. 
	I've mostly made changes to the LunchApp class (GUI).

-	Everything now works properly.	 

-	No major unsolved errors have occurred so far.

-	The workload so far is about 30h

-	I’m still a bit ahead of my plan.

-	You can now change the language to english from the GUI if you want to. I added a URL object which contains all the restaurant's urls all in one place.
	I also changed the way the lunchapp works so now it doesn't save the menus into text files and instead instantly fetches the menus off the internet.
	I did this because from the user's perspective, it didn't make much sense to have to refresh the menus every day if you wanted to get the newest menus.
	I made some small improvements to the menuFinder and menuFilter classes. I also added four new sodexo restaurants to the app.
	
-	Everything works properly.

-	No major unsolved errors have occurred so far.

-	The workload is about 40 hours.

-	I'm pretty much done at this point.
